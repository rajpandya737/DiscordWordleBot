# DiscordWordleBot


made in like 2022 or smthn, super old


This isn't really something that I am offeing for others in different servers, it is more just a personal 
project to help develop my confidence with things like files, try catch, and python syntax

I had a lot of fun making it, here is the link for a version you can try without discord. There are very 
similar except this one does not use discord and instead just uses CLI
